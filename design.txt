Design Document: Time Management for CS50Monica Mishra	monicamishra@college.harvard.eduTF: Rob Bowden  Angel Jin 	ajin@college.harvard.eduTF: Karen Xiao 			Technical Overview:This website is written primarily in PHP, and flavored with HTML and CSS. There are also a few dashes of Javascript thrown in for accessing and validating user inputs and fields. The site has five primary pages: index.php, about.php, contact.php, event.php, and event_confirmation.php. These five principle pages consist of the HTML layout of each page with php include statements embedded in to include code used across all the pages such as header.php and footer.php (found in the includes directory). Additionally, event.php and event_confirmation.php use a function called render() (found in includes/functions.php) to use values inputted by the user to display custom HTML and CSS on the page. The event_confirmation.php page is unique in that it can only be accessed once the user has submitted a successful "Add an Assignment" request. In addition to the main five pages, there exists a templates folder. Included in the templates folder, are apology.php, event_confirmation_form.php, and event_form.php. These files consist of HTML and CSS code whose contents shift based on what values are passed in. These values are passed in through a call such as : "render('event_confirmation_form.php', ["hours" => $hours,"type" => $type, "name" => $name]);"". This particular call was made in event_confirmation.php. apology.php is called when the user has inputted an incorrectly formatted value.The includes folder, contains footer.phpDesign Process:Obstacles During the Implementation Stage:Next Steps:
