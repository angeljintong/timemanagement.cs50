Purpose: It is a truth universally acknowledged that the key to a successful academic career is proper time management. But how many of us actually know how to manage our time? Well never fear, because Time Management for CS50 is here! Time Management for CS50 makes academic success a reality by automatically generating a study plan catered to your academic needs, allowing you to spend more time actually studying and less time wasting on fruitlessly planning how to study. 

Overview: Time Management for CS50 is built to work with Google Calendar, allowing you to customize your study plan to your schedule immediately. The home page (index.php) displays your current Google calendar. Any events that you independently add to your calendar will be visible here.

Make sure to enter it in the specified MM/DD/YYYY format. Finally, the system allows you to estimate how much time in hours you believe the assignment will take you to complete. Once you’re finished, click submit to finalize your event.

Today’s date, along with the due date are also displayed.
